                <p style="font-family: 'Josefin Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;color: white;font-size:16px;text-align: justify;">Schools are better known as formal institutions, where the education is imparted in a systematic way and all the steps are correlated. It is for a definite period in schools, colleges and universities etc. The aim of education, rules for teaching, curriculum, etc. are fixed. The whole system of education is well planned. Everything is under rules and regulations. It cannot be imparted without school.
                
                A community is a solid group with some degree of ‘we feeling” and living in a given area. Community is a cluster of proper living within a narrow territorial radius which shows a common way of life. Schools are mini society and the success depends on the relations with society. Commonly school is that school which develops the characteristics of community in the students and prepares them for the progress of the community.</p>
